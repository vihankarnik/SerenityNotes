### Project Overview
* This project is a simple note-taking application built using the GTK toolkit in C. It allows users to create, edit, and delete text-based notes, which are stored as individual files on the system.
* GTK serves as the primary graphical user interface toolkit and it completely handles the UI building of this application. It uses various GtkWidgets such as windows, grid layouts, text views and buttons and arranges them accordingly 
* Input-Output of files is handled by the GIO and GLib system library APIs that comes with GTK4.

### Features
* Create, edit, and delete text notes that save automatically to drive.
* User-friendly interface with a grid layout for organizing notes.
* Automatically saves notes to individual text files.

### How to execute
To build on Windows, follow the steps:
* Recommended to use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) which provides a Unix-like environment and a command-line interface for compiling and building on Linux software that runs on Windows.
* Run the `MinGW64` environment that comes with `MSYS2`.
* Install and set up git:  
```
pacman -S git
```
* Install `gtk4` for the `MINGW64` environment:  
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4
```
* Clone repository to your computer using SSH:  
```
git clone git@github.com:vihankarnik/SereneNotes.git
```
* Go to `/src` inside the new folder created and compile the C code:  
```
cd serenenotes/src
gcc app.c -o app.exe $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4)
```
* Run the compiled file:
```
./app.exe
```

### Usage
* Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a grid layout containing your existing notes, or a single note if it is your first time.
* To create a new note, click the "+" button.
